Primary Colors (Brand Identity)
These are the core colors derived directly from the logo and banner.

Shibl Crimson (Primary Brand Color)

Hex: #AF0C15 (Approximate based on image)

Usage: Primary buttons (CTA), active states, sticky headers, and key icons.

Psychology: Energy, passion, and urgency. In an educational context, it stimulates attention.

Deep Charcoal (Primary Text)

Hex: #1F1F1F (Not pure black, which is too harsh on screens)

Usage: Headings, main body text, and the logo logotype.

Pure White

Hex: #FFFFFF

Usage: Backgrounds, card surfaces, and text overlaid on the Red.

Secondary & Support Colors (UI Needs)
You cannot build a functional platform with just red and black. You need neutrals and semantic colors.

Soft Cloud (Backgrounds)

Hex: #F8F9FA

Usage: Page backgrounds (to differentiate from white cards/modules).

Slate Grey (Secondary Text)

Hex: #636E72

Usage: Subtitles, metadata (dates, author names), and inactive icons.

Success Green (Semantic)

Hex: #27AE60

Usage: Completion markers, "Correct Answer" indicators, and success toasts. Use sparingly to avoid clashing with the red.

2. UI/UX Recommendations
A. Layout & Visual Language: "Fluid & Organic"
Observation: The banner (image 3) uses white, fluid, wave-like lines on the red background.

Recommendation: Do not use sharp, rigid squares for your UI elements.

Use Rounded Corners (Border-radius: 12px to 16px) for cards, buttons, and input fields to mimic the organic feel of the banner.

Use the Wave Motif as a subtle background pattern for the header or footer to tie the UI back to the marketing visuals.

B. Typography
Arabic Support is Critical: The logo uses a custom, rounded Arabic script.

Recommendation:

Headings: Use a modern, geometric Arabic font like "Cairo" or "Almarai" (Google Fonts). These match the thickness and modern feel of the logo.

Body Text: Use "IBM Plex Sans Arabic" or "Tajawal" for excellent readability in long-form educational content.

C. Imagery & Cultural Resonance
Observation: The imagery is specific to the Gulf region (Omani attire).

Recommendation: Ensure all stock photography or illustrations used in the platform reflect this specific demographic. Do not use generic Western-style corporate photos. The platform needs to feel "local" and "trusted."

D. User Roles & Hierarchy
Since this is an educational platform (LMS), you likely have three users: Student, Parent, and Teacher.

Students: Use more of the Red and engaging visuals. Keep the UI "gamified" (progress bars, badges).

Parents/Admin: Keep the dashboard cleaner, using more White and Grey space. They need data visualization (charts of their child's progress).

E. Accessibility Warning
The Trap: White text on that specific Red is readable, but Dark text on Red is not.

Rule: Never place the Charcoal/Black text on top of the Red background. It will be illegible. Always use White text on Red buttons/banners.

3. Suggested Component Styles (CSS Logic)
To give the developers a head start, here is a quick style guide concept:

Primary Button:

Background: #AF0C15

Text: White

Border Radius: 50px (Pill shape to match the fluid lines)

Hover: Darken red by 10%

Cards (Course/Lesson Containers):

Background: White

Shadow: 0px 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08) (Soft, modern shadow)

Border: None (let the shadow define the edge)
